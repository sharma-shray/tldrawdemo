Note for expected automated test failures:

1.  faliure in e2e pack due to broken file uploads not considering keywords
2.  one faliure in api pack where the get keyword endpoint can not handle missing keyword (unless thats expected)
3.  All security checks fail for the application under test

Bugs:

1. Incorrect Swagger Documentation for POST Endpoint
   The Swagger documentation for the POST /api/images endpoint is inaccurate. It does not properly describe the required request body fields, missing required attributes or constraints.

2. Missing Implementation for 400 Status Code in GET Request
   The GET /api/images endpoint does not return a 400 Bad Request response when an invalid keyword is provided. The API should validate input and return an appropriate error response.

3. UI Fails to Send Keywords to API When Creating an Image
   When a user creates an image through the UI, the keywords field is not sent to the API, leading to missing metadata in the stored images.

4. Calendar Popups Lack Unique Identifiers
   All calendar popups in the application lack unique identifiers, making automated testing and accessibility improvements difficult. Unique identifiers should be added to enhance testability and usability.

5. Swagger Documentation Does Not Follow Official Guidelines
   The API documentation does not adhere to official Swagger/OpenAPI guidelines, leading to inconsistencies and potential confusion for developers integrating with the API.

6. Duplicate Image Uploads Allowed Without Validation
   The application allows users to upload duplicate images without any validation or warnings. It is unclear if this is the expected behavior or an oversight.

7. No Defined Behavior for Image Upload Failures
   The system does not specify how the application should handle image upload failures. A clear failure-handling mechanism (e.g., retries, error messages) should be defined.

8. Missing URL Validation in POST Requests
   There is no validation for URLs provided in the POST /api/images request. If the API accepts image URLs, it should validate them to prevent broken or malicious links.

9. No Defined File Name Size Limits
   There are no restrictions on the size or length of filenames for uploaded images. This could lead to storage and display issues.

10. No Limits on Keyword Length or Quantity
    The API does not enforce any restrictions on the length or number of keywords assigned to an image, which may lead to performance or storage concerns.

11. Missing Date Validation in API Requests
    The application does not validate date fields where applicable, which may lead to inconsistencies or invalid data entries.

12. No Rate Limiting Implemented for API
    The API lacks rate limiting, making it susceptible to abuse through excessive requests, potentially degrading system performance.

13. SQL Injection Risks Not Addressed
    The API does not appear to have protections against SQL injection attacks, posing a security risk for database integrity and data privacy.

14. New Fields Can Be Added to API Without Proper Handling
    The API allows additional fields to be included in requests without validation, which could lead to unintended behavior or security vulnerabilities.

15. No Protection Against Malicious Image Uploads
    The system does not check uploaded images for malicious content. There should be validation and security measures (e.g., file type validation, virus scanning) to prevent security threats.

16. Application Performance Degrades With More Than 30 Images
    When more than 30 images are present, the applicationâ€™s response time slows to over 3000ms, indicating a potential performance bottleneck. Optimization may be required for better scalability.

17. The end date filter removes the images which are uploaded on the same date
    This could be by design but cause confusion for the user

18. The get keyword end point also matches with title
    This could be by design

19. The get keyword end point is designed to take only single keyword but swagger documentation syas it can take multiple keywords
